# Membership

## Communication

The [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/newbury-hackspace) is our official form of communication with the membership. This is where meetings are arranged, polls are taken and discussion occurs. Please consider membership of the Google Group mandatory to maximise your participation in the Hackspace.

Interactive (informal) chat occurs on [Slack](https://nadhack.slack.com/). Please ask another member for an invitation and we shall be glad to add you.

## Membership levels

### Domestic Members

All membership fees are discretionary. It costs us approximately ₤25/month/member and that is our guideline monthly membership for members. We list a "Basic Member" below as a guideline for those interested in the Hackspace who feel that their own time or financial constraints make the ₤25/month rate inappropriate for their personal situation.

Some members pay less than ₤25/month and some members pay more. We ask potential members to assess the value of the space to their own situation, consider the costs of running the space and identify a monthly fee which suits them.

### Commercial Members

Commercial Membership rates are non-negotiable.
